# ReAct-Agent-with-LangGraph-OpenAI-Tavily

This project demonstrates a stateful AI agent using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).  

The agent uses an LLM to reason and call [Tavily Search](https://www.tavily.com/) via `TavilySearchResults`, a tool that performs real-time web search and returns rich results in a ReAct-style loop.

I have also included another agent with persistence and streaming features
